# Your blog post content here...

a few months ago, i quickly threw together a personal site using astro in hopes of reducing the friction in posting content in the form of blog posts. i have things set up such that adding a markdown document to the github repo for this site automatically gets it gets built and deployed as a new blog post.

apparently, this didnt reduce friction enough, as evidenced by the fact that i still havent actually written anything yet. still, putting my thoughts and ideas here is i want to do, so i’ve been thinking of ways to make that even easier.

i don't usually have time to sit down at a full-size keyboard to write, and typing on a phone keyboard is excruciatingly slow. as such, voice transcription was an intriguing option for me since it’s hands-free and easily accessible (as long as i have my phone).

to make this even more streamlined, i decided to try playing around with iphone shortcuts. this is (in my opinion) a criminally underutilized tool in ios, and something i want to experiment with more.

over the weekend, i created an iphone shortcut that does the following:

1. start voice transcription

2. paste the transcribed text into a note for later reference

3. send the text to chatgpt and ask it to format it as markdown and correct anything it thinks is a transcription error

4. take that markdown from the chatgpt response and append it to the original note for comparison

5. open the note

there are some hiccups with this workflow, most notably that voice transcription seems to have a character limit or a timeout, because it will randomly stop listening after a while. this post took two runs through this workflow to complete. there are probably workarounds i can try to mitigate this issue, but i haven't dug into it yet.

overall, i'm happy with how this workflow. it worked reasonably well for writing this post. only time will tell what effect it will have going forward on reducing the friction in posting.
